    <p>This is how you make the frosting for the cake. This is where the magic happens.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces powdered sugar</li>
        <li>4 ounces pasteurized egg whites</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>16 ounces unsalted butter softened to room temperature but not melted</li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 TINY drop purple food coloring to offset the yellow color (optional)</li>
        <li>3 drops electric pink food coloring for the flowers</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon white sprinkles for decorating</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Place egg whites and powdered sugar in a stand mixer bowl. Attach the whisk, combine ingredients on low and then whip on high for 5 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and salt.</li>
        <li>Add in your softened butter in chunks and whip with the whisk attachment to combine. It will look curdled at first. This is normal. It will also look pretty yellow. Keep whipping. </li>
        <li>Whip on high for 8-10 minutes until it's very white, light and shiny. If you don't whip it enough, it could end up tasting buttery.</li>
        <li>Optional: If you want whiter frosting, add in a tiny drop of purple to counteract the yellow in the butter (too much will make the frosting grey or light purple.)</li>
        <li>Optional: Switch to a paddle attachment and mix on low for 15-20 minutes to make the buttercream very smooth and remove air bubbles. This isn't required but if you want really creamy frosting, you don't want to skip it. </li>
        <li>After your cakes are chilled, fill them with your favorite frosting and frost the outside. If you're not familiar with decorating cakes, check out my how to make your first cake blog post! Watch the video to see how I made the palette knife buttercream flowers.</li>
