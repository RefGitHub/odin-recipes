    <p>This is the best cake to ever exist. It's so good it's dangerous.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces whole milk to be mixed with the oil</li>
        <li>3 ounces canola oil</li>
        <li>6 ounces whole milk to be mixed with the eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract or 1 vanilla bean pod</li>
        <li> 3 large eggs room temperature</li>
        <li>13 ounces cake flour</li>
        <li>13 ounces granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>8 ounces unsalted butter softened to room temperature but not melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 335º F/168º C . Prepare three 8"x2" cake pans with cake goop or another preferred pan release.</li>
        <li>Place the 4 oz of milk in a separate measuring cup. Add the oil to the milk and set it aside.</li>
        <li>To the remaining 6 oz of milk, add the vanilla and room temperature eggs. Whisk gently to combine. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into the bowl of your stand mixer with the paddle attachment.</li>
        <li>Turn the mixer onto the slowest speed. Slowly add chunks of your softened butter until it is all added then let everything mix until it looks like coarse sand.</li>
        <li>Add your milk/oil mixture all at once to the dry ingredients and mix on medium (speed 4 on kitchenaid, speed 2 on the Bosch) for 2 full minutes to develop the structure. Set a timer! Don't worry, this will not over-mix the cake.</li>
        <li>After 2 minutes, scrape the bowl. This is an important step. If you skip it, you will have hard lumps of flour and unmixed ingredients in your batter. If you do it later, they will not mix in fully.</li>
        <li>Slowly add in the milk/egg mixture while mixing on low, stopping to scrape the bowl one more time halfway through. Mix until just combined. Your batter should be thick and not too runny.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter into your greased cake pans and fill ¾ of the way full. I like to weigh my pans to make sure they're even.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes and check your cakes. Do the "done test". Insert a toothpick to see if it comes out clean. Sometimes wet batter doesn't show up so make sure it's clean and not just wet. Then gently touch the top of the cake, does it spring back? Oven temperatures vary so if it's not done yet, bake for a few more minutes (2-3) and check again until it passes the "done" test.</li>
        <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and give them a tap on the countertop to release air and prevent too much shrinking. Let them cool on a cooling rack until they are barely warm.</li>
        <li>After cooling for about 10 minutes, place the cooling rack on top of the cake, placing one hand on top of the cooling rack and one hand under the pan and flip the pan and the cooling rack over so the pan is now upside down on the cooling rack. Remove the pan carefully. Repeat with the other pan.</li>
        <li>After the cakes are fully cooled, carefully wrap them in plastic wrap and place them into the freezer or fridge for about 30 minutes to firm up the cakes and make them easier to handle for stacking.</li>
    </ol>
